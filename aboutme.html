          Hello and welcome to my website!
        </p>
          <p id="thicc">
          My name is Victoria Maness and I am from Dallas, TX.
          I am currently on the job market for a new role in digital marketing.
           In the past, I held the positions of Marketing Coordinator, Social Media Manager, and Marketing Intern;
           Through these positions, I hold experience in event marketing, graphic design, and various areas of digital marketing (for more, check out my Resume).

           <p id="thicc">
           I am an artist at heart and I find excitement in pursuits that combine the creative process, strategy, and technology--all of which are essential parts of marketing.
           I knew I wanted to choose this career path when I had my first taste of marketing in the real world--
           I was assigned to work with a local business and a nonprofit to help develop their marketing campaigns in my undergrad marketing courses.
           My teams and I worked on a wide range of elements within a marketing campaign (ranging from market research, to creative briefs, to graphics, to experiential and social media marketing plans), and I recall how stimulating the  process was;
          this experience was enriching to say the least and definitely catapulted my interest!
        </p>

          <p id="thicc">
          Other things about me aside from marketing is that I like to create art, play with my cats, explore nature and food spots, lift weights, and travel (last two dating pre-pandemic).
          If you'd like to chat about similar interests or marketing, please feel free to shoot me an Email! :)
