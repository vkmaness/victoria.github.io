        <p id="thicc">
          Hello and welcome to my website!
        </p>
          <p id="thicc">
          My name is Victoria Maness and I am from Dallas, TX.
          Currently, I am seeking a position in digital marketing.
           I have experience in positions such as Marketing Coordinator at Washington Prime Group (REIT), Social Media Manager at Beauty Cuts (hair salon), and Marketing Intern at The Artist Evolution (marketing agency).
           Through these roles I cultivated skills in event marketing, graphic design, and various areas of digital marketing (for more, please click here to view my <a href="VictoriaManessresume.pdf">resume</a>).

           <p id="thicc">
           I am an artist at heart and I find excitement in pursuits that combine the creative process, strategy, and technology--all of which are essential parts of marketing.
           My interest in this career path was affirmed when I had my first taste of marketing in the real world.
           During my undergraduate studies, I had opportunities to aid in the development of marketing campaigns with a local business and a nonprofit.
           In these courses, my teams worked on a wide range of elements within a marketing campaign--ranging from market research, to creative briefs, to graphics, to experiential and social media marketing plans;
           I recall how stimulating this experience was and how it intensified my interest even further!

          </p>

          <p id="thicc">
          Other things about me aside from marketing is that I like to create art, play with my cats, explore nature, try new food, lift weights, and travel (unfortunately last two dates pre-pandemic).
          If you'd like to chat about similar interests and/or marketing, please feel free to send me an <a href="mailto: victoriakmaness@gmail.com">email</a> or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-maness/">LinkedIn</a>!
